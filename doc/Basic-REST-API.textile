This cheat sheet provides a review of the RESTful API for Rexster. Note that beyond the query parameters provided in the table below, the standard Rexster parameters @rexster.offset.start@, @rexster.offset.end@, and @rexster.returnKeys@ also work in cases where it makes sense. The @<graph>@ is the unique name of a graph configured within Rexster. The base of the URI, when running locally, is generally @localhost:8182@.

Please note that there are [[Rexster MIME Types]] that affect operations within the API.

^1^ Only applies to @SailGraph@ configurations.
^2^ Underlying graph database implementations must support the ability to assign the edge/vertex identifier.  In cases where the graph database does not support the identifier (ie. Neo4j), the identifier supplied with be ignored and the graph assigned identifier will be returned in the JSON after successful graph element creation.
^3^ Note that when POSTing an index you may also pass a @params@ query string argument.  This argument allows configuration parameters to be passed into the index itself (support of this feature is specific to the graph implementation itself).  Please read the Neo4j Blueprints implementation for an "example":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Neo4j-Implementation on how to configure an index.  The @params@ argument is [[parsed to JSON|Mapping a URI to JSON]] so a query string that looked like @params.to_lower_case=true&params.type=fulltext&params.provider=lucene@ would construct a map of three index parameters.
^4^ Rexster utilizes "Vertex Query":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Vertex-Query capabilities of Blueprints for these noted operations.  These operations accept the following parameters: @_label@, @_properties@ and @limit@.

* @_label@ filters edges by label and may be either a single value or an array of values as in @_label=[created,knows]@
* @_skip@ the number of elements to ignore before taking results
* @_take@ the number of elements to take from the returned set
* @_properties@ is an array of edge properties to filter on in the following fashion: @_properties=[ [weight,>,(f,0.5)], [weight,<,(f,1.0)] ]@.  Note that property values respect [[Rexster Data Typing|Property Data Types]] and the following comparators: @<=, <, <>, >, >=@. 

Since these REST operations are returning lists, the standard Rexster Parameters (discussed below) apply.  Choosing to use @rexster.offset.end@ to limit to the top N results, is different than using @_take@ in that @_take@ pushes this filtering operation down to the underlying graph making it more efficient than @rexster.offset.end@ which does that filtering within Rexster itself.  The same can be said of the use of @_skip@ and @rexster.offset.start@.  This approach also helps those buffering large results sets from Rexster, where the @_take@ size greater than the the desired buffer.

In all cases, parameters may be POSTed or PUTed on the [[URI|Mapping a URI to JSON]] or as JSON using one of the [[Rexster MIME Types]].

h1. Rexster Parameters

* @rexster.offset.start@ - Expects a numeric value that represents the start point for returning a set of records and is used in conjunction with @rexster.offset.end@ to allow for paging of results.  If used without a valid @rexster.offset.end@ parameter specified, Rexster will return all remaining records in the set.    
* @rexster.offset.end@ - Expects a numeric value that represents the end point for returning a set of records and is used in conjunction with @rexster.offset.start@ to allow for paging of results.  If used without a valid @rexster.offset.start@ parameter specified, Rexster will assume the start value to be zero.
* @rexster.returnKeys@ - Expects a comma separated list of property names to return in the results.  Element meta-data will always be returned even if @rexster.returnKeys@ are specified.  If a valid value for this parameter is not specified, then all properties are returned.
