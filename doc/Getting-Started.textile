The Rexster distribution comes configured with the "TinkerPop Toy Graph":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Property-Graph-Model and the "Grateful Dead dataset":https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-More-Complex-Property-Graph. This section will describe the basics of loading up the Rexster web server and accessing some basic services.

h1. Building and Installing Rexster

There are two ways to start working with Rexster: building the latest from source or "downloading":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/wiki/Downloads a pre-built version.  Building Rexster from the latest source code, assumes that you have "Git":http://git-scm.com/ installed and "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/ and can be accomplished with the following commands:

```text
git clone https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster.git
cd rexster
mvn clean install
```

h1. Starting the Rexster Web Server

There is a shell script called @rexster.sh@. When that script is evaluated at the command line with the @--start@ option, it starts up the Rexster web server. 

```text
./bin/rexster.sh --start
```

Note that using the @rexster.bat@ requires backslashes instead of forwardslashes at the command line.

[[Rexster Configuration]] is handled through an XML file.  By default, Rexster looks for a file called @rexster.xml@ in the root of the working directory.  Please be aware sample @rexster.xml@ files are provided with the standard Rexster packaging.  If that file cannot be found, Rexster tries to load @rexster.xml@ as a "resource":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/blob/master/src/main/resources/com/tinkerpop/rexster/rexster.xml packaged within Rexster itself.   It is possible to make use of different configuration through a different XML file by calling:

```text
./bin/rexster.sh --start -c other.xml
```

```text
[INFO] Application - .:Welcome to Rexster:.

```

h1. GETing the Basics

When the web server is loaded, it is possible to get the list of of currently loaded graphs as well as other server information by accessing the base-URI:

@http://localhost:8182/graphs@

The result of GETing this base-URI should look as follows (consider using the "JSONView":http://jsonview.com/ plugin for Firefox or Chrome for nicely formatted JSON)

```js
{
    "version": "*.*",
    "name": "Rexster: A Graph Server",
    "graphs": [
        "tinkergraph",
        "gratefulgraph",
        "tinkergraph-readonly",
        "emptygraph"
    ],
    "queryTime": 3.480889,
    "upTime": "0[d]:00[h]:06[m]:53[s]"
}
```

To look at the properties of an individual graph, append the names of one of the values from the "graphs" array above to the base-URI as in:

@http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph@

and the result will look like:

```javascript
{
    "version": "*.*",
    "name": "tinkergraph",
    "graph": "mocktinkertransactionalgraph[vertices:6 edges:6 directory:data/graph-example-1]",
    "features": {
        "ignoresSuppliedIds": false,
        "supportsTransactions": false,
        "supportsSelfLoops": true,
        "supportsBooleanProperty": true,
        "supportsEdgeKeyIndex": true,
        "supportsUniformListProperty": true,
        "supportsThreadedTransactions": false,
        "isPersistent": true,
        "supportsVertexIndex": true,
        "supportsStringProperty": true,
        "supportsIntegerProperty": true,
        "isWrapper": false,
        "supportsMixedListProperty": true,
        "supportsVertexKeyIndex": true,
        "isRDFModel": false,
        "supportsLongProperty": true,
        "supportsVertexIteration": true,
        "supportsKeyIndices": true,
        "supportsEdgeIteration": true,
        "supportsPrimitiveArrayProperty": true,
        "supportsDoubleProperty": true,
        "supportsSerializableObjectProperty": true,
        "supportsIndices": true,
        "supportsEdgeIndex": true,
        "supportsMapProperty": true,
        "supportsFloatProperty": true,
        "supportsDuplicateEdges": true
    },
    "readOnly": false,
    "type": "com.tinkerpop.rexster.util.MockTinkerTransactionalGraph",
    "queryTime": 1.297372,
    "upTime": "0[d]:00[h]:08[m]:17[s]"
}
```

Reading more about the [[Basic REST API]] for Rexster will help in learning more about how general access to the graph will work.

h1. The Dog House

[[The Dog House]] provides for browser-based access to some of the underlying Rexster services (basic vertex/edge browsing and [[Gremlin|Gremlin Extension]] console) and by default is available at: 

@http://localhost:8182/doghouse@

h1. Stopping the Rexster Web Server

To shutdown the web server:

```
./bin/rexster.sh --stop
```

This will properly release resources and shutdown the server and exit.  The following will appear in the server console: 

```text
[INFO] ShutdownManager$ShutdownSocketHandler - Received request for shutdown
[INFO] ShutdownManager - Calling ShutdownListener: com.tinkerpop.rexster.Application$1@4a93837b
